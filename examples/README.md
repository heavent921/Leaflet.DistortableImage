#### Demo

### 5. Reconstruct Map from URL
#### Description: 
MK-lite now supports reconstruction of maps from MRF saved on archive.org.  
#### How to Use the Feature:
##### Using MK-Lite Generated MRFs
i. Construct shareable URL as below:<br>
	Type1 https://localhost:8080/examples/archive.html?k=[identifier].<br>
	Type2 http://localhost:8081/examples/archive.html?json=[https://archive.org/download/mkl-2-2/mkl-2-2.json].<br>
ii. Load the shareable URL Type1 on your browser to reconstruct the map.<br>
iii.Ensure you replace "[identifier]" with the identifier provided by archive.org.<br>
iv. Alternatively, load shareable URL Type2 on your browser to reconstruct the map.<br>
v.  Ensure you replace "[https://archive.org/download/mkl-2-2/mkl-2-2.json]" with the URL provided by IA<br>
iv. Steps ii or iv will restore your map to its previous state and you can continue further knitting tasks.<br>
#### Demo

##### Using MRFs from Legacy mapknitter.org
i.  Construct shareable URL as below:<br>
	Type3 https://localhost:8080/examples/archive.html?kl=[file-name].<br>
	Type4 http://localhost:8081/examples/archive.html?json=https://archive.org/download/mapknitter/[file-name].json.<br>
ii. Load shareable URL Type3 or Type4 on your browser to reconstruct the map.<br> 
iii.Ensure "[file-name]" is replaced with the MRF name (e.g., -emf-, 01_03_cockroach_75m, --10 etc.).<br>
iv. This restores your map to its previous state and you can continue further knitting tasks.<br>

##### Note: 
* Names of the legacy MRFs are available here: http://localhost:8081/examples/mapknitter.html.<br>
* Legacy MRF with image objects having no coordinates are downloaded and placed on the sidebar, not the tile layer.<br>
* "Identifier" is generated by archive.org once you upload the downloaded MRF to the service.<br> 
   For example,<br>
	If your downloaded MRF from MK-Lite is "mkl-2-2.json", upon uploading to archive.org you will receive the<br>
	URL https://archive.org/download/mkl-2-2/mkl-2-2.json to access the uploaded file.<br> 
	"mkl-2-2" is the identifier.

### 6. Drag and Drop Downloaded MRF to Reconstruct Map
#### Description: 
A user can reconstruct map by dragging and dropping an MRF onto tile layer. 
#### How to Use the Feature:
i.  Load URL https://localhost:8080/examples/archive.html or https://localhost:8080/examples/local.html on your browser.<br>
ii. Close dialog box if any is displayed. At this point, the tile layer is cleared.<br>
iii.Drag and drop the MRF onto the tile layer.<br>
